# Small ESP8266 Robot
## Short Description
This is a small 2-wheel robot project. Normally not very special. ðŸ˜‰

But there some special topics (at least for me ðŸ˜Š)

My first project with a self developed PCB (made in China)
Usage of standard components (easy to get and therefore cheap)
Design with a standard 18650 Lipo (charging with a USB-C connector)
3d printed chassis with a nice design (made by me)
Usage of an ESP8266 (Wemos D1 mini) with some special features: - programming via micro usb interface - Wifi access point to control the robot (very nice easy web-interface) Please have a look @ this repository ðŸ˜Š

## How to use
Please download the whole project and open it direktly in Visual Studio Code. 
PlatformIO Extension is necessary.
